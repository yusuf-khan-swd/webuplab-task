        An About Us Page is a page on your website that tells your readers all
        about you. It includes a detailed description covering all aspects of
        your business and you as an entrepreneur. This can include the products
        or services you are offering, how you came into being as a business,
        your mission and vision, your aim, and maybe something about your future
        goals too. Your About Us page is your perfect opportunity to tell a
        compelling story about your business. Even though an About Us page is
        one of the most important elements of a website, it is often one of the
        most overlooked elements. Compared to a landing page, an About Us page
        help you communicate a range of things:
      </h2>
    </div>
  );
};

export default About;
